  Executive Summary
</h2>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  <strong>Zeroshot Bio</strong> is at the forefront of a paradigm shift in drug development, focused on building 
  <em>advanced biological foundation models</em> that bring unprecedented clarity to the preclinical development 
  of complex therapeutic candidates. Our approach leverages the unique strengths of zebrafish as a scalable, 
  high-fidelity model system, in combination with cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics and state-of-the-art 
  AI techniques. The result is an integrated platform that delivers deep insights into gene-network interactions, 
  enabling pharmaceutical companies to detect potential toxicities and efficacy signals early in the drug 
  development process—an area where traditional animal models and classical screening methods have 
  consistently fallen short.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Our pitch deck, included in this data room, provides a concise overview of the problems we address. 
  It details the alarming decline in Phase I success rates over the past two decades, underscoring how 
  the complexity of modern therapeutics creates a bottleneck in conventional pipelines. Many high-impact, 
  network-driven therapies never reach clinical testing due to insufficient early-stage confidence—an issue 
  that costs the industry billions in wasted investment and missed opportunities. 
  <strong>Zeroshot Bio’s</strong> innovative approach overcomes these challenges by generating massive, 
  AI-ready datasets from zebrafish experiments, training advanced transformer-based models (our 
  <strong>tsGPT engine</strong>), and delivering actionable, translatable insights for human therapeutic outcomes.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  We have a targeted <strong>market opportunity</strong> that focuses on mid-tier biotechs and CROs needing 
  external expertise to bridge the translational gap between in vivo models and human clinical outcomes. Our early 
  traction strategy involves robust pilot programs and initial customer engagements, laying the groundwork 
  for deeper partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies. The ultimate goal is clear: provide a new level 
  of preclinical confidence that accelerates development timelines, reduces late-stage failures, and opens up 
  previously unexplored therapeutic avenues.

  Business Overview – An Integrated Approach
</h3>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  By uniting market opportunity, business model, and competitive landscape, Zeroshot Bio reveals a coherent 
  ecosystem centered around a fundamental notion: <em>massive, high-quality single-cell data in a scalable 
  vertebrate model</em>, continuously feeding into a sophisticated AI foundation model. We begin by generating 
  robust zebrafish data in a dedicated wet lab, ensuring each new experiment not only benefits our clients 
  but also enriches the underlying <strong>scGPT</strong> architecture. Over time, we accumulate a unique 
  repository of in vivo single-cell states—healthy, diseased, and drug-perturbed across multiple life stages. 
  This consistency and scale far surpass typical public datasets, and forms the critical training resource 
  powering our next-generation AI.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  <strong>Monetization</strong> follows multiple streams: direct payment for custom experiments, subscriptions 
  to an inference platform, enterprise or pay-per-query APIs, and milestone-based collaborations with major 
  pharma players. From quick-turn toxicity screening to multi-year pipeline support, each engagement deepens 
  the model’s capabilities and broadens our data advantage. Unlike most zebrafish CROs, we don’t simply 
  deliver morphological readouts—we combine them with comprehensive single-cell transcriptomics, creating a 
  self-improving data asset at the core of our business.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Our strategy also differentiates us from standard single-cell analytics firms: we maintain full control 
  of the lab pipeline ourselves, closing the loop between experiment and AI training. A bridging approach 
  to human scRNA data further addresses the largest translational question: ensuring that signals found in 
  zebrafish extend meaningfully to human biology.
</p>

  Key Advantages and Challenges
</h3>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  We recognize that <strong>challenges</strong> remain—securing sufficient funding, establishing robust 
  quality-assurance processes, and working with regulatory bodies to accept zebrafish-based findings. Yet 
  the underlying momentum is strong: as the market seeks to mitigate the soaring cost of late-stage drug 
  failures, an approach that systematically reduces risk via highly granular gene-network analysis is 
  primed for success. By harnessing advanced single-cell technology, a well-chosen model organism, and an 
  iterative AI feedback loop, we speak directly to the industry’s move toward “fail-fast” mentalities, 
  pruning questionable leads early while advancing promising ones with far greater confidence.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  Timing is on our side. Single-cell sequencing is more routine and affordable than ever, zebrafish labs can 
  be scaled more easily than rodent-based facilities, and the pharma sector is increasingly open to external 
  AI collaborations. The next evolutionary step—incorporating advanced foundation models specifically trained 
  on single-cell data—positions Zeroshot Bio at the leading edge of this wave. Each new dataset boosts the 
  <strong>tsGPT engine</strong> (or future <em>scGPT</em>) in predictive power and coverage, creating a network 
  effect that few competitors can match with disjointed or publicly available datasets alone.
</p>

<h3 class="roboto-slab-semibold text-lg text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">
  Strategic Outlook
</h3>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  As more network-driven therapeutics—like CRISPR gene editing, CAR-T, or next-generation ADCs—enter 
  development, the demand for multi-gene, multi-pathway insights will escalate. Zebrafish-based single-cell 
  foundation models offer exactly that: a whole-organism perspective at scale, with a capacity for 
  cost-effective experiments unattainable in rodents. By aligning well with emerging regulatory 
  conversations and incorporating partial human data for translational assurance, we provide a compelling 
  solution for modern drug discovery.
</p>

<p class="roboto-slab-regular text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
  Ultimately, <strong>Zeroshot Bio</strong> aims to become an indispensable part of the pharmaceutical R&amp;D 
  toolbox—capable of validating (or invalidating) drug candidates far earlier and with far greater resolution. 
  This is the future of preclinical confidence: a tightly integrated loop between lab, AI, and biology, 
  designed to accelerate the path to safer, more effective therapies.
