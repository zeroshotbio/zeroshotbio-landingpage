        A Case Study: Mylotarg

        <strong> Mylotarg is a cancer drug first approved in 2000. </strong> 
        Intricate networks of interaction among thousands of genes, proteins and signaling molecules 
        underlie every biological process.
        This inherent chaos explains why despite our best efforts
        scientists still struggle to turn fundamental discoveries into reliable therapies.

             Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) is an antibody-drug conjugate. It targets the CD33 
             antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through a cytotoxic calicheamicin payload.
